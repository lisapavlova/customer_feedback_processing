This is a repository containing notebook code for review analytics solution which, through the means of Machine Learning, _predicts review aspect, review polarity (sentiment), and reviewer's repurchase intention._ 


### 1. Demo
Examples of aspect labelling:
![review rated with 3 stars](/demo_review_vis_solid/vis_AXUL79019117227993_rate3_plot.png)
![review rated with 1 star](/demo_review_vis_solid/vis_ADHK02763847289959_rate1_plot.png) 
![review rated with 3 stars](/demo_review_vis_solid/vis_EIPI94329159470821_rate3_plot.png)
The percentage values signify prediction score - the level of model's certainty with the aspect prediction. Colors represent larger aspect categories.

### 2. Models
Models were developed from pretrained [rubert-tiny2] one, fine-tuned to perform 3 classification tasks. Performance results for each of them are presented below:

| Model | Test F1 (macro avg) | # of labels | 
| :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | 
| aspect  | 0.94  | 32  |
| repurchase       | 0.9        | 2       |
| binary polarity       | 0.87        | 2       | 
| multi-class polarity       | 0.34 / 0.43*        | 5       |
